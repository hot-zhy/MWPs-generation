Then, we can sum up all the squared numbers to get the final result.\n\nHere's the code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef solution():\n    \"\"\"Calculate the sum of squares from 5^2 to 15^2\"\"\"\n    start = 5\n    end = 15\n    result = 0\n\n    for num in range(start, end+1):\n        result += num**2\n\n    return result\n```\n\nIn this code, we initialize the starting number as 5 and the ending number as 15. We also initialize the result variable to 0. Then, we use a for loop to iterate through the numbers from start to end (inclusive). Inside the loop, we calculate the square of each number using the exponentiation operator `**` and add it to the result variable. Finally, we return the result.\n\nTo get the solution, you can call the `solution()` function."]}
