", "answer": "SymPy Code Start\n# Define the symbol\nn = symbols('n', integer=True)\n\n# Define the equation based on the problem statement\n# Original square array: n^2 + 5 = total number of students\n# After adding a row and a column: (n+1)^2 = total number of students + 26\nequation = Eq(n**2 + 5, (n+1)**2 - 26)\n\n# Solve the equation for n\nsolutions = solve(equation, n)\n\n# Since we're looking for a number of students, we discard negative solutions\nresult = [sol for sol in solutions if sol.is_positive]\nSymPy Code End\n\nNow, let's provide you with the result of this calculation. Since the code assigns the results to a variable named 'result', and we are looking for positive integer solutions, I'll assume that the code correctly finds such a solution. Here's what the final answer would be, assuming the code has been run in a Python environment with SymPy:\n\n```python\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe output should give you the number of students in Year 4 that meets the conditions of the problem. \n\nPlease note: I cannot actually execute the code and directly provide the numerical value of the result. You would need to run the code snippet provided in a Python environment with SymPy installed to get the numerical value for the number of Year 4 students."}

If we execute the code, we would get the result. Please run the code in your environment to find the number of students in Year 4.\n\n### Correction:\nThe symbolic definition of the conditions should be:\n\ncondition1 represents that the number of students is a perfect square plus 5, so n should be a square of an integer, p, so n = p**2 + 5. This condition was incorrectly represented earlier.\ncondition2 represents that when adding one row and one column to the square of students, we should get a new square q such that q = p+1 â‡’ q**2 = n + 26 or (p+1)**2 = p**2 + 5 + 26 = p**2 + 31. The condition should be written accordingly.\n\nThe corrected code should be:\n\nSymPy Code Start\n# Define the symbol\nn, p = symbols('n p')\n\n# Define the perfect square students count as p^2\n# Then n = p^2 + 5 since there is a surplus of 5 students\n\n# When one row and one column are added, (p + 1)^2 students are needed which is 26 more\n# So, p^2 + 5 + 26 = (p + 1)^2\n# Solve for p\nsolution = solve(Eq(p**2 + 31, (p + 1)**2), p)\n\n# Find the positive integer solution for p\np_value = next(s for s in solution if s.is_real and s > 0)\n\n# Calculate n using p_value\nresult = p_value**2 + 5\nSymPy Code End\n\nAfter executing the corrected code, `result` will hold the number of students in Year 4."}
